    Abstraction function

    This class represents a dynamic collection of objects. The collection has a finite size
    and a finite time limit. Objects that have exceeded the time limit will be removed and
    objects that are added when the collection is full take the place of the least
    recently used object currently in the collection.

    Each key in masterMap is the unique identifier of an object and the value is
        a DetailedObject containing an object that has been added by the user

    Thread safety argument:

    The datatype is thread safe as all the methods that mutate the buffer (all of them) are thread safe.
        Any possible data race methods are synchronized so that no data races can occur
    Methods that support removal from the data structure are all synchronized and additionally we have
        used defensive copying to minimize rep exposure between threads
    The decision to make every method mutate the buffer, but also be synchronized was in favour of safety
        over speed, and so the entire FSFTBuffer data structure is also thread-safe
